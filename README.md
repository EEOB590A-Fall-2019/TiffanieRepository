# 590 A: R Data Management

# Publicly available USDA data on National Food Consumption was analyzed to find trends and differences across years food category and income level.
# Data will be used as a baseline for a larger study of US food systems at a city scale.

# The R scripts in this repository were used to determine:

# 1. The US national trends for food consumption by food category (fruit, vegetable, grain, oil, meat, dairy) annually from 1994 - 2007. 

# 2. The difference between low and high income food consumption when compared to the average.

# 3. A simulated data set for vegetable consumption was statistically analyzed for significant differences across years and income levels. 

#HSR notes: Great job with class assignments & simulating data & making graphics for your presentation. Thanks for being an enthusiastic and engaged part of this class!
