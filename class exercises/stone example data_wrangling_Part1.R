#EEBOB590A: Data Wrangling part 1
#Use this script to:
  #1) Load data into R
  #2) Explore data
  #Side Note) learn how to pipe
  #3) fix column names (rename)
  #4) add/remove/split/combine columns (unite,separate)
  #5) reshape (spread, gather)
  #6) change class of columns
  #7) fill in missing data
  #8) join tables
  #9) print tidy database

#load libraries the classic way
library(tidyverse)#loads ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, dplyr, stringr, forcats
library(readxl) #hadley wickham's package for reading in excel files. not in Tidyverse.
library(lubridate) #garett grolemund & hadley wickham's package for dates

##### Step 1 - Load data.  ############
#There are multiple ways to do this, which impacts your imported dataframe. The key things that vary are how R interprets your blank values & NA's, and how R assigns a class to each column.

#option 1: if a csv or table, use read.csv or read.table.
transplant <- read.csv("data/raw/transplant_raw.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA", "na", " "))

#option 1b:
transplant_csvreadr <- read_csv("data/raw/transplant_raw.csv", na = c("", "NA", "na", " "))

# #option 2: if excel, use readxl(). (note- rest of code works better with read.csv version)
# transplant_excel <- read_excel("data/raw/transplant_raw.xlsx", sheet = 1, col_names = T, col_types = NULL) #col_types = null is default, and readxl guesses what each column is. by default, readxl converts blank cells to missing data. use na="yourcode" if you have a code you use for missing values.

##### Step 2: Explore data ##########

#compare dataframes from above to see what happens using read.csv, read_csv, and readxl
str(transplant) # str shows the structure of your dataset
str(transplant_csvreadr) #most variables are read in as characters
str(transplant_excel) # most variables are character class. dates are read in intelligently, though, although it added the current year because year was missing.

summary(transplant) #gives summary information, which can help you identify if any columns are in the wrong class or if there are data entry errors or a lot of NA's etc.
names(transplant) #show column names

##### Side note: Introduction to piping #########
#Each function returns an object, so calls can be chained together in a single statement, without needing variables to store the intermediate results.
# it takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. When describing it, you can think of it as a "THEN".

meanwebGuam <- transplant %>%
  subset(Island == "Guam") %>% #changes to filter to stay in the tidyverse
  summarise(mean(WebSize.cm.))

# the code chunk above will translate to something like "you take the transplant data, then you subset the guam data and then you calculate the meanwebsize".

#Here are four reasons why you should be using pipes in R:

# You'll structure the sequence of your data operations from left to right, as apposed to from inside and out;
# You'll avoid nested function calls;
# You'll minimize the need for local variables and function definitions; And
# You'll make it easy to add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations.

##### Step 3: Standardize/clean inconsistencies in column names, class etc. ##########

# 3.1: Rename column headings
#Use the rename function in the dplyr package
#new name is on left, old name is on right.
transplant <- transplant %>%
  rename(island = Island, 
         site = Site, 
         web = Web.., 
         native = Native, 
         netting = Netting, 
         startdate = Start.Date, 
         enddate = End.Date, 
         totaldays = Total.Days, 
         spidpres = SpidPres, 
         webpres = WebPres, 
         WebSize = WebSize.cm.)

colnames(transplant) #note that I left one with uppercase letters; I will return to that later

# 3.2: Fix upper case/lower case issues in column names
#change column names from upper to lowercase

transplant <- transplant %>%
  rename_all(tolower)

#To see column names, use colnames or names
colnames(transplant)
names(transplant)

##### Step 4: Add, remove, split, combine columns ############

#4.1: Add a column

#4.1.1: Add column directly
transplant$year <- 2013 #this experiment happened in 2013. Added this in a new column

#4.2: Remove a column
#use "Select" - to select columns from a dataframe to include or drop
transplant <- transplant %>%
  select(-totaldays)

colnames(transplant)

#4.3: Separate one column into two columns
transplant <- transplant %>%
  separate(col=web, into=c("web_a", "web_b"), sep="'", remove = F) 
#remove=F tells R to leave the original column

colnames(transplant)

#4.4: Combine two columns into one
transplant$startdate <- as.character(transplant$startdate)

transplant <- transplant %>%
  unite(startdate, c(startdate, year), sep="-", remove=F)

transplant$enddate <- as.character(transplant$enddate)

transplant <- transplant %>%
  unite(enddate, c(enddate, year), sep="-")

##### Step 5: Reshape database (i.e. if wide, change to long; if long, change to wide)  ########################

#5.1: Change data from long to wide format using tidyr::spread()
transplantwide <- transplant %>%
  spread(webpres, WebSize) #the values in webpres will be the new column names, and the columns will be populated by the values in websize

#5.2: Change data from wide to long using tidyr::gather()
# Gather moves column names into a key column, gathering the column values into a single value column.
# The arguments to gather(data, key, value, ..., factor_key):
# data: Data object
# key: Name of new key column (make a new name for the column that will contain the names of the column headings in the wide format)
# value: Name of new value column (make a new name for this column that will contain the values currently populating the rows in the wide format)
# ...: Names or column numbers for source columns that contain values (e.g. 10:12)
# factor_key=T: Treat the new key column as a factor (instead of character vector)

transplant_long <- transplantwide %>%
  gather(key = "webpres", value = "WebSize", no, yes) #note that we have now added a row with "NA" for every observation - this is undesirable for analysis, but serves to show how to go from wide to long

##### Step 6: Change class of columns ############################
# 6.1: Change class of a single column
transplant$island <- as.factor(transplant$island)

# 6.2: Change class of multiple columns at a time

transplant <- transplant %>%
  mutate_at(vars(island, site, web, native, netting, spidpres), 
                   factor)

######## Step 7: Fill in missing values ##############
transplant_comp <- transplant %>%
  complete(island, site)  #note - this is meaningless, just to show how it works

#can use fill to fill in information from the most recent nonmissing value
transplant_comp <- transplant_comp %>%
  fill(web)

##### Step 8) Combine datasets (Join) ####################
#you have two tables, table x (considered "left" table) and table y (considered "right" table)
preycap <- read_csv("data/tidy/preycap_tidy.csv")

#Left Join: join matching values from y to x. Return all values of x, and all columns from x and y, but only those from y that match. If multiple matches between x and y, then all combinations are returned.
leftjoin_transprey <- transplant %>%
  left_join(preycap, by = c("island", "site"))
#Use by = c("col1", "col2", ...) to specify one or more common columns to match on.

#Right Join: join matching values from x to y. Return all rows of y, all columns from x and y, but only those from x that match. As above, if multiple matches, all combinations are returned.
rightjoin_transprey <- transplant %>%
  right_join(preycap, by = c("island" = "island", "site" = "site"))
#Use a named vector, by = c("col1" = "col2"), to match on columns that have different names in each table. le _join(x, y, by = c("C" = "D"))

#Inner Join: Join data. Retain only rows from x and y that match, and all columns from both. If multiple matches between x and y, then all combination of matches are returned.
innerjoin_transprey <- transplant %>%
  inner_join(preycap, by = c("island", "site"))

#Full Join: Join data. retain all values, all rows from both x and y
fulljoin_transprey <- transplant %>%
  full_join(transplant, preycap, (by = c("island", "site")))

#let's figure out why we have 5502 obs and 18 variables for each of these join types
levels(as.factor(preycap$island))
levels(transplant$island)
levels(as.factor(preycap$site))
levels(transplant$site)

fulljoin_transprey %>%
  group_by(island, site) %>%
  summarize(numrows = n())

preycap %>%
  group_by(island, site) %>%
  summarize(numrows = n())

transplant %>%
  group_by(island, site) %>%
  summarize(numrows = n())

#since there are lots of matches for island and site, you get a row for every combination. i.e. for anao, get 13 rows in transplant each duplicated for 112 rows from preycap, for a total of 1456 rows.


##### Step 9: write csv file with tidy dataset into tidy folder #########

#create tidy database for analysis
write.csv(transplant, "data/tidy/transplant_tidy.csv", row.names=F)
